## 🐶🐱 Task: Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Cats vs Dogs Classification

### 📘 Description
This project implements a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to classify images of cats and dogs using the Kaggle dataset.  
The goal is to accurately distinguish between cats and dogs based on image data.

### 🧠 Objective
- Group images into "Cat" and "Dog" categories using SVM.
- Evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

### 🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- OpenCV / TensorFlow (if used for image preprocessing)

### ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Import libraries and load dataset.  
2. Preprocess images (resize, grayscale, normalize, flatten).  
3. Split dataset into training and testing sets.  
4. Train **SVM classifier** (`sklearn.svm.SVC`).  
5. Evaluate model performance (accuracy, confusion matrix).  
6. Visualize sample predictions.

### 📊 Output
- Model accuracy on test data  
- Sample predicted images with labels  

### 📁 Dataset
**Kaggle Dataset:** [Dogs vs Cats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog)  
> Download the dataset and extract the `train` and `test` folders before running the notebook.

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.  
2. Mount or upload the dataset.  
3. Run all cells sequentially.  
4. View the accuracy and prediction results.
